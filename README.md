# Description
Implement binary search algorithm in swift

<h2>Basic knowledge for binary search:</h2>
<p><b>Binary search works on sorted arrays. </b></p>
<p>Binary search begins by comparing an element in the middle of the array with the target value. </p>
<p>If the target value matches the element, its position in the array is returned. </p>
<p>If the target value is less than the element, the search continues in the lower half of the array. </p>
<p>If the target value is greater than the element, the search continues in the upper half of the array. </p>
<p>By doing this, the algorithm eliminates the half in which the target value cannot lie in each iteration.</p>
